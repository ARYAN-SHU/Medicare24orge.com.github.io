        20 health tips for 2022-23

    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="yoga.jpg">
        <p>The start of a new decade brings with it new resolutions to improve one’s life, including a healthier
            lifestyle.
            Here
            are 20 practical health tips to help you start off towards healthy living in 2020.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="heading">
        1. Eat a healthy diet
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="diet.jpg">
        <p>

            Eat a combination of different foods, including
            fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains.
            Adults
            should
            eat at
            least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables
            per day. You can improve your intake of fruits and
            vegetables
            always including veggies in your meal.
            eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks.
            eating a variety of fruits and vegetables.
            By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and non-communicable
            diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="heading">
        2. Consume less salt and sugar
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="less salt.jpg">
        <p>

            Filipinos consume twice the recommended amount of s
            odium, putting them at risk of high blood pressure,
            which
            in
            turn
            increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most pe
            ople get their sodium through salt. Reduce your
            salt
            intake to 5g
            per day, equivalent to about one teaspoon. It’s easier
            to do this by limiting the amount of salt, soy
            sauce,
            fish sauce
            and other high-sodium condiments when preparing meals;
            removing salt, seasonings and condiments from
            your
            meal
            table;
            avoiding salty snacks; and choosing low-sodium products.

            On the other hand, consuming excessive amounts of sugars
            increases the risk of tooth decay and unhealthy
            weight
            gain. In
            both adults and children, the intake of free sugars shoul
            d be reduced to less than 10% of total energy
            intake.
            This is
            equivalent to 50g or about 12 teaspoons for an adult. WHO
            recommends consuming less than 5% of total
            energy
            intake for
            additional health benefits. You can reduce your sugar intak
            e by limiting the consumption of sugary
            snacks,
            candies and
            sugar-sweetened beverages.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="heading">

        3. Reduce intake of harmful fats
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="fat.jpg">
        <p>
            Fats consumed should be less than 30% of your total energy intake. This will help prevent unhealthy
            weight
            gain and NCDs. There are different types of fats, but unsaturated fats are preferable over saturated
            fats
            and trans-fats. WHO recommends reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake; reducing
            trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and replacing both saturated fats and trans-fats to
            unsaturated fats. The preferable unsaturated fats are found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower,
            soybean, canola and olive oils; saturated fats are found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil,
            cream,
            cheese, ghee and lard; and trans-fats are found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and
            foods,
            such as frozen pizza, cookies, biscuits, and cooking oils and spreads.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">

        4. Avoid harmful use of alcohol
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="alcohol.jpg">
        <p> There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol can lead to health problems such as
            mental
            and behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis, some
            cancers
            and heart diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence and road clashes and collisions.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">
        5. Don’t smoke
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="smoke.jpg">
        <p>

            Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Tobacco kills not only the
            direct
            smokers
            but even non-smokers through second-hand exposure. Currently, there are around 15.9 million Filipino
            adults
            who
            smoke
            tobacco but 7 in 10 smokers are interested or plan to quit.

            If you are currently a smoker, it’s not too late to quit. Once you do, you will experience immediate and
            long-term
            health benefits. If you are not a smoker, that’s great! Do not start smoking and fight for your right to
            breathe
            tobacco-smoke-free air.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="heading">

        6. Be active
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="active.jpg">
        <p>
            Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy
            expenditure. This includes exercise and activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out
            household
            chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits. The amount of physical activity you need
            depends
            on your age group but adults aged 18-64 years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
            physical
            activity throughout the week. Increase moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week for
            additional health benefits.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">
        7. Check your blood pressure regularly
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="bp.jpj.jfif">
        <p>
            Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is called a “silent killer”. This is because many people who have
            hypertension may not be aware of the problem as it may not have any symptoms. If left uncontrolled,
            hypertension can lead to heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. Have your blood pressure checked
            regularly
            by a health worker so you know your numbers. If your blood pressure is high, get the advice of a health
            worker. This is vital in the prevention and control of hypertension.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">
        8. Get tested
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="hiv.jpg">
        <p>
            Getting yourself tested is an important step in knowing your health status, especially when it comes to
            HIV,
            hepatitis B, sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB). Left untreated, these
            diseases
            can lead to
            serious
            complications and even death. Knowing your status means you will know how to either continue preventing
            these
            diseases
            or, if you find out that you’re positive, get the care and treatment that you need. Go to a public or
            private
            health
            facility, wherever you are comfortable, to have yourself tested.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="heading">
        9. Get vaccinated
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="vacinated.jpg">
        <p>
            Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases. Vaccines work with your body’s
            natural
            defences to build protection against diseases like cervical cancer, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis B,
            influenza, measles, mumps, pneumonia, polio, rabies, rubella, tetanus, typhoid, and yellow fever. In the
            Philippines, free vaccines are provided to children 1 year old and below as part of the Department of
            Health’s routine immunization programme. If you are an adolescent or adult, you may ask your physician
            if to
            check your immunization status or if you want to have yourself vaccinated.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">
        10. Practice safe sex
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="safe.jpg">
        <p>
            Looking after your sexual health is important for your overall health and well-being. Practice safe sex
            to
            prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhoea and syphilis. There are available
            prevention measures such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that will protect you from HIV and condoms
            that
            will protect you from HIV and other STIs.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">
        11. Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="cough.jpg">
        <p>
            Diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis are transmitted through the air. When an infected
            person coughs or sneezes, infectious agents may be passed on to others through airborne droplets. When
            you
            feel a cough or sneeze coming on, make sure you have covered your mouth with a face mask or use a tissue
            then dispose it carefully. If you do not have a tissue close by when you cough or sneeze, cover your
            mouth
            as much as possible with the crook (or the inside) of your elbow.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">
        12. Prevent mosquito bites
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="mosquto.jfif">
        <p>
            Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals in the world. Diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria and
            lymphatic filariasis are transmitted by mosquitoes and continue to affect Filipinos. You can take simple
            measures to protect yourself and your loved ones against mosquito-borne diseases. If you’re traveling to
            an
            area with known mosquito-borne diseases, consult a physician for a vaccine to prevent diseases such as
            Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever or if you need to take antimalarial medicines. Wear
            light-coloured,
            long-sleeved shirts and pants and use insect repellent. At home, use window and door screens, use bed
            nets
            and clean your surroundings weekly to destroy mosquito breeding sites.

        13. Follow traffic laws
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="trafic.jfif" width="120">
        <p>
            Road crashes claim over one million lives around the world and millions more are injured. Road traffic
            injuries are preventable through a variety of measures implemented by the government such as strong
            legislation and enforcement, safer infrastructure and vehicle standards, and improved post-crash care.
            You
            yourself can also prevent road crashes by ensuring that you follow traffic laws such as using the
            seatbelt
            for adults and child restraint for your kids, wearing a helmet when riding a motorcycle or bicycle, not
            drinking and driving, and not using your mobile phone while driving.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="heading">
        14. Drink only safe water
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="drink.jfif">
        <p>
            Drinking unsafe water can lead to water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis A, typhoid
            and
            polio. Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. Check
            with
            your water concessionaire and water refilling station to ensure that the water you’re drinking is safe.
            In a
            setting where you are unsure of your water source, boil your water for at least one minute. This will
            destroy harmful organisms in the water. Let it cool naturally before drinking.

        15. Breastfeed babies from 0 to 2 years and beyond
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <img id="pic" src="babies.jfif">
        <p>
            Breastfeeding is the best way to provide the ideal food for newborns and infants. WHO recommends that
            mothers
            initiate
            breastfeeding within one hour of birth. Breastfeeding for the first six months is crucial for the baby
            to
            grow
            up
            healthy. It is recommended that breastfeeding is continued for up to two years and beyond. Aside from
            being
            beneficial
            to babies, breastfeeding is also good for the mother as it reduces the risk of breast and ovarian
            cancer,
            type
            II
            diabetes, and postpartum depression.

            different ways, but it might make you feel hopeless or worthless, or you might think about negative and
            disturbing thoughts a lot or have an overwhelming sense of pain. If you’re going through this, remember
            that
            you are not alone. Talk to someone you trust such as a family member, friend, colleague or mental health
            professional about how you feel. If you feel that you are in danger of harming yourself, contact the
            National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727).

        17. Take antibiotics only as prescribed
    </h1>
    <div class="container">

        <p>
            Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest public health threats in our generation. When antibiotics
            lose
            their power, bacterial infections become harder to treat, leading to higher medical costs, prolonged
            hospital stays, and increased mortality. Antibiotics are losing their power because of misuse and
            overuse in
            humans and animals. Make sure you only take antibiotics if prescribed by a qualified health
            professional.
            And once prescribed, complete the treatment days as instructed. Never share antibiotics.

            Hand hygiene is critical not only for health workers but for everyone. Clean hands can prevent the
            spread of
            infectious
            illnesses. You should handwash using soap and water when your hands are visibly soiled or handrub using
            an
            alcohol-based
            product.
